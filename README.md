# Advent-of-Code-2020
My solutions to the problems of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). 
Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I solved all the problems using R (although some are missing from here). Even though I didn't consider myself a beginner in R, my main use for it has always been data analysis. Solving the problems helped me developed some skills which were not necessarily up to par, like string manipulation, regular expressions, and more. Somewhere along the middle of the road, I also decided I would make it my goal to write elegant, readable code, which is always good to develop as a programmer.

And, more importantly, it was great fun!

To me, the main challenge when using R is that it is an interpreted language and, therefore, relatively slow. This means that you cannot simply brute force every problems by throwing for loops at them. This is good, since it forces you to come up with creative solutions to a variety of problems.
